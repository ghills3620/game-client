# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. I have brought you a digital version to play on any computer or mobile platform.

## How To Play

Your goal is to win the tic-tac-toe board by getting three in a row - either across, down, or diagonally. One player will start the game by placing thier designated letter on the board.
